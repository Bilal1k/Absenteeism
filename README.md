# Absenteeism

In this project, an attempt to build machine learning algorithms that can predict hours of absenteeism of workers will be made. Multiple algorithms will be tried and an ensemble will be built from the best models.  

This dataset was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.
It was acquired from UCI Machine Learning Repository. For more information check (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work).

This project was made using R Studio version 1.2.5019. R version 3.6.1.

This repo contains 5 files. A PDF, an Rmarkdown, an R file containing all the code used in building this project, the gitignore file and this readme file.
